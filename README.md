## Charlene Chetcuti

I am a software engineer in training, having just joined Maker's Academy for a 16 week programming bootcamp.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

Throughout my engineering degree and my experience at work, I have been challenged with several problems which I always try to tackle logically and enthusiastically.    

#### Team Work

I have had several opportunities to work in teams both during university and at work  - I enjoy collaborating and working with others, as I feel it promotes learning and development of new ideas.
